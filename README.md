# Running the project in dev mode

To start the project first run `yarn install`, then you need to create a `.env` file:

```
LOGIN=<login>
PASSWORD=<password>
```

Where `<login>` and `<password>` are the login information of the account you wish to use during development. On your first run you may be stuck on a window that simply says redirecting, just refresh your browser and the application should start working as intended.
